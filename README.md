Hello! If you are reading this, you are likely a future Academy class! (... or you somehow found it randomly)

This is an application developed by the R&D Department of Unperplexed Solutions during the 2016-2017 school year.

If you would like to use this app, you can. Just use the following steps to get it working on either a school desktop or a personal
computer. 

1. Download and install Meteor. (https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Download the entire app from the repository. (https://github.com/brendongu/us-uniprep --> Clone or download --> Download ZIP)
3. Create a folder for Meteor projects in the computer's C:\ drive.

    - If you are using a school desktop, open Windows Powershell
    
        - Type the following commands into Powershell:    (If it isn't obvious, hit enter after each command)
        
            `set-location C:`                         (This will take you to the C:\ drive from the default H:\ drive)
            
            `cd users`
            
            `cd *your account*`                       (your school login username: ie. nguyenj (John Nguyen); gub (Brendon Gu))
            
            `mkdir Meteor`                            (This will create a Meteor directory (folder) in your personal folder)
            
            `cd M`
